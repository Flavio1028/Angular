  ### Executing the front-end

You need to have Node.js / NPM installed locally.

1. Install all the required dependencies:

```
npm install
```

2. Execute the project:

```
npm run start
```

This command will run the Angular project with a proxy to the Java server, without requiring CORS.

Open your browser and access **http://localhost:4200** (Angular default port).
